Dreadnought

A battleship-like game supporting online play.

This project is being developed as part of Dr. Zhong's Data Communication and Networking class at Troy University.

The project will be written using Java.

There will be two basic parts:

1) The server. 

2) The client. 

The clients will communicate with the server using sockets.

Two clients which want to play will contact a running dreadnought-server and pair up to play against each other.

We would also like for the clients to be able to chat with each other.

Development Strategy:

First we build a prototype which is played locally and has a
text based cli interface.
Then we add support for online play and add a gui interface.

Each player gets one of each of the following types of ships:

Type of ship        Length
aircraft carrier    5
battleship          4
destroyer           3
submarine           3
patrol boat         2

There is one grid for each player.
The size of the grid is traditionally 10x10.
Traditionally the rows are given the numbers 1-10
and the columns are given the letters A-L
Shots are described as [row][column]
eg: fire A10

The ships cannot overlap, ie each square is occupied by at most one ship.

Phases of Gameplay:

Deployment
The players choose where to place there ships.
The players can also change the orientation of their ships from horizontal
to vertical. Ships are horizontal by default.

Rounds
The players take turns firing shots into each others grid.
A shot is either a hit or a miss.
If the shot is a hit, the player may continue firing.
The players turn ends when the player misses.
