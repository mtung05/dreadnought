Dreadnought

A battleship-like game supporting online play.

This project is being developed as part of Dr. Zhong's Data Communication and Networking class at Troy University however anyone is welcome to contribute.

The project will be written using Java.

There will be two basic parts:

1) The server. 

2) The client. 

The clients will communicate with the server using sockets.

Two clients which want to play will contact a running dreadnought-server and pair up to play against each other.

We would also like for the clients to be able to chat with each other.
